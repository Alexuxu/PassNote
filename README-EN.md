# PassNote - A Simple & Secure Android Password Manager

PassNote is an open-source, offline-first password management application for Android, developed with the assistance of Gemini and built with modern Android development technologies. It allows you to securely store and manage your passwords locally on your device, giving you full control over your data.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Secure Local Storage**: All your data is stored locally in a Room database. Nothing is ever sent to the cloud.
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Easily add, view, edit, and delete your password entries through a clean and intuitive UI.
- **Powerful Search**: Quickly find the password you need with a fuzzy search for services/companies on the main screen.
- **Smart Suggestions**:
  - **Username Suggestions**: Automatically suggests frequently used usernames from a dropdown menu when adding a new entry.
  - **Customizable Password Generator**: Generate strong, random passwords with configurable length and a customizable set of special characters.
- **Data Management**:
  - **CSV Import/Export**: Easily back up and restore your data. The app supports exporting to a `passnote.csv` file and importing from CSVs (with optional `Notes` field).
  - **Bulk Delete**: Clear all data from the database with a single tap (with confirmation).
- **Personalized Settings**:
  - **Dynamic Threshold**: Customize the threshold for when username suggestions appear.
  - **Password Rules**: Tailor the random password generator to your needs (length, custom characters, enable/disable special characters).
  - **Persistent Settings**: All your preferences are saved locally using Jetpack DataStore.
- **Modern UI**: Built entirely with Jetpack Compose and Material 3, featuring a clean, modern design with adaptive theming (Light/Dark mode) that follows your system's settings.
